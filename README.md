# Visual-Tracking-Maze-Navigation
A small vehicle that could autonomously navigate through a maze using an on-board visual processing system. 
Used a Raspberry Pi 3B that ran an object-oriented C++ program, interfaced with a Raspicam, and processed 
visual turn signals using the OpenCV API. Also programmed a manual mode to allow the vehicle to be piloted 
through laptops via WiFi.
